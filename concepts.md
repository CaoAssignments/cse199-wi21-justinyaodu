## Problem Topics

### algebra

### coordinate-plane

Points on a coordinate plane. More complex geometric objects go under [geometry](#geometry).

### combinatorics

Counting the number of ways to do something, using combinatorial principles like the sum rule, product rule, and inclusion/exclusion.

### geometry

Geometric objects in two or more dimensions, like rectangles, circles, line segments, and linear inequalities. [Intervals](#interval) are considered separately.

### graph

Graph data structures.

### interval

Intervals on a one-dimensional number line.

### number-line

Positions on a one-dimensional number line.

### number-theory

Prime numbers, modular arithmetic, divisibility, etc.

### optimization

Minimizing or maximizing some quantity under the constraints given in the problem. Often involves use of the `min` and `max` functions.

### path

Path finding on a grid or a graph. Includes finding the shortest path, the path with the maximum/minimum edge weight, etc.

### tree

Tree data structures.

## Data Types and Data Structures

## 1d-array

One-dimensional arrays, including arrays of boolean values. Includes resizable arrays like Java's `ArrayList`.

## 2d-array

2D arrays or other two-dimensional grids, like a chessboard or playing field.

### bit-operations

Bit shifting, bitwise AND/OR/XOR/NOT, two's complement, bit sets.

### heap

Heap data structures, like Java's `PriorityQueue`.

### map

Map data structures, like Java's `HashMap` and `TreeMap`.

### set

Set data structures, like Java's `HashSet` and `TreeSet`.

### string

String manipulation, including substrings and pattern matching.

## Problem-Solving Strategies

### brute-force

Checking every possible candidate in order to find the answer. This often involves nested loops.

### flood-fill

Coloring or marking contiguous regions that satisfy a certain property.

### greedy

A simple and intuitive algorithm that finds the optimal solution.

### recursion

Using recursive functions.

### sorting

Ordering objects in some way to make solving the problem easier. This could include sorting events by time, sorting positions and intervals on a number line, or sorting objects by an attribute (like their size).

### searching

Finding a specific element from an array of objects, or a more abstract set of possibilities.

### simulation

Directly simulating a sequence of events, using the processes described in the problem.
