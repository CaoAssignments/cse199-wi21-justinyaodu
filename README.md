# Concept Analysis

_Detailed analysis of each solution can be found in the comments of each solution file. Each solution passes all of the test cases in analysis mode._

## 2020 US Open (Bronze)

### Social Distancing I

Key concepts:

* Optimizing a specific value (distance between cows)
  * Using `min` and `max` functions to represent "this and that" and "this or that" choices
* Reasoning about intervals
* Using case analysis to account for each possibility that could be optimal

A little bit of:

* String splitting
* Searching arrays (and possibly sorting, depending on the implementation)

### Social Distancing II

Key concepts:

* Optimizing a specific value (largest possible infection radius)
* Sorting objects by an attribute (sorting cows by position)
* Iterating through an array and comparing adjacent elements

### Cowntact Tracing

Key concepts:

* Sorting objects by an attribute (sorting hoof shakes by time)
* Brute force with nested loops (simulating all possibilities of patient zero and all relevant possibilities for K)
